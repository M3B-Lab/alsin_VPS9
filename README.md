# alsin_VPS9
This repository contains all the necessary data to replicate the simulations of the paper "Molecular insights into IAHSP: influence of the R1611W mutation on the VPS9 domain of alsin", which has been submitted but not published.

The input data to replicate the simulations are organized as follows:
- `md.mdp`: The mdp file used to run the simulations in GROMACS.

- `VPS9_WT/`: Folder regarding the molecular dynamics simulation of VPS9 WT system.

  - `tpr/`: Folder containing the tpr files for each replica.

  - `Topologies/`: Folder containing the topology defining the system.

- `VPS9_R1611W/`: Folder regarding the molecular dynamics of VPS9 R1611W system.

  - `tpr/`: Folder containing the pdb and tpr files.

  - `Topologies/`: Folder containing the topology defining the system.
